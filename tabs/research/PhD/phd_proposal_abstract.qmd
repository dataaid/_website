## PhD Proposal Title:

**A Bayesian Machine Learning Framework for Integrating Historical Controls and Pharmacometric Models in Drug Development**

## **Proposal Description:**

This research addresses a pivotal challenge in modern drug development: the effective and ethical utilization of historical control data (HCD) in clinical trials. HCD, encompassing data from past trials, offers invaluable insights into disease natural history, treatment response variability, and potential safety signals. Leveraging HCD has the potential to streamline clinical trials, reduce costs, and minimize patient exposure to potentially ineffective or harmful interventions (Mistry et al., 2021). The growing recognition of this potential is evidenced by the increasing acceptance of HCD by regulatory agencies like the FDA and EMA, particularly in rare diseases or situations where large control groups are difficult to recruit (Food and Drug Administration, 2018; European Medicines Agency, 2017).

Despite this growing acceptance, several challenges hinder the seamless integration of HCD. Concerns regarding data heterogeneity, bias stemming from differences in study design, patient populations, or treatment standards, and the evolving nature of clinical practice pose significant hurdles (Schmidli et al., 2014). Additionally, the statistical complexity of analyzing HCD often necessitates sophisticated methodologies that may not be readily accessible to all researchers.  Ethical considerations regarding patient consent and the potential for denying patients access to novel treatments further complicate the landscape (van der Graaf et al., 2020).

To address these multifaceted challenges, this research proposes the development of a robust and flexible Bayesian machine learning framework. This framework will systematically integrate HCD and pharmacometric models (PMMs) to enhance the efficiency and informativeness of clinical trials while rigorously quantifying uncertainties and risks.

## **Key Objectives:**

1.  **Intelligent Selection and Weighting of HCD (with ML):** Leverage a synergistic combination of Bayesian methods and advanced machine learning techniques to develop algorithms that intelligently identify, select, and weight the most relevant HCD. This will involve:

  *   **Supervised and Unsupervised Learning:** Employing algorithms like random forests (Breiman, 2001) and gradient boosting (Friedman, 2001) to predict HCD relevance based on patient characteristics, trial design, and other relevant features. Unsupervised techniques such as clustering or dimensionality reduction (Van Der Maaten & Hinton, 2008) will be used to identify patterns and group similar trials.
  *   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilizing NLP techniques (e.g., transformer models like BERT; Devlin et al., 2018) to extract pertinent information from unstructured text data (e.g., clinical trial reports) to assess HCD quality and identify relevant details.
  *   **Reinforcement Learning:** Exploring the potential of reinforcement learning (Sutton & Barto, 2018) to create agents capable of learning and optimizing HCD selection and weighting strategies over time.
  *   **Bayesian Optimization, BNNs, and PGMs:** Integrating Bayesian techniques like optimization (Snoek et al., 2012), neural networks (Neal, 1996), and graphical models (Koller & Friedman, 2009) to enhance the efficiency, flexibility, and uncertainty quantification of the HCD selection process.

2.  **Integration of Pharmacometric Models (PMMs):** Incorporate PMMs into the Bayesian framework, recognizing their unique ability to capture the complex dynamics of disease progression and drug effects over time. Unlike simpler longitudinal models, PMMs offer a mechanistic understanding of disease processes, explicitly account for drug effects and inter-individual variability, and have superior predictive power for both treated and untreated disease trajectories (Mould & Upton, 2012). By integrating PMMs, the framework will leverage a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms to enhance predictions of treatment outcomes.

3.  **Quantification of Uncertainty and Risk:** Employ Bayesian methods to rigorously quantify uncertainty in the predictions and inferences made from the HCD and PMMs. This quantification will facilitate more informed decision-making, enabling a balanced assessment of the potential benefits of new treatments against their risks (O'Hagan et al., 2006).

## **Research Questions:**

*   How can a combination of Bayesian and machine learning methods be most effectively leveraged to identify and weight the most relevant HCD?
*   What are the optimal strategies for integrating pharmacometric models into a Bayesian framework to enhance the prediction of treatment outcomes?
*   What are the best approaches for quantifying and communicating uncertainty and risk associated with using HCD and PMMs to inform decision-making?
